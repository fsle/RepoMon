## RepoMon

### Why?

Idea comes from [that tweet](https://x.com/SoSoValue/status/1910518663893180888).
```
Weâ€™re excited to share that SSI has officially completed all smart contract audits, with reports delivered by top security firms including: 
@BlockSecTeam, @SlowMist_Team, @zenith256, @TenArmor, @zellic_io, and @Quantstamp.
```

Detailed chronology [here](https://sosovalue-white-paper.gitbook.io/sosovalue-whitepaper/9.-resources/9.2-audits).

### What?

It populates a json which represents all the monitord files in repositories.

The tool should be launched regularly to monitor any diff (new, updated or deleted files).

Currently sends a notification message to a telegram channel when a update is detected.


### Install

```
pip3 install requests
